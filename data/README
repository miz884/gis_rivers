Data location

W05: 
river flow path line data.

W07: 
river basin area mesh data.

W05 processing river flow path
===============
01. Put all downloaded files (W05-**_**_GML.zip) in ./W05_river_path directory.

02. Execute batch_W05.sh
It processes all ./W05_river_path/W05*.zip files by using W05_parser.py.
It writes the results into ./result/W05_river_path_data/<RIVER_CODE>.data files.

03. Execute batch_W05_kmlgen.sh
It actually generates KMZ files even its name is KMLgen.
It reads files from ./result/W05_river_path_data/ and generates a KML file by using W05_kmlgen.py.
It writes the results in /tmp/ directory.
It zip the KML file into a KMZ file.
Eventually, it writes the KMZ files in ./result/W05_river_path_kmz/<RIVER_CODE>.kmz.


===============
W07 processing basin area mesh
===============
01. Put all downloaded files (W07-*_*-jgd_GML.zip) in ./W07_river_mesh directory.

02. Execute batch_W07.sh
It processs all ./W07_river_mesh/W07*.zip files by using W07_parser.py.
The W07_parser.py writes the results into ./result/W07_river_mesh/<RIVER_CODE>.csv files.

How to import data into Google Cloud SQL?
===============

01. Create tables
Before importing data, you need to create tables to import data.
You can create tables by importing a SQL file which contians DDLs.
